##The goal of this task is to develop a Chrome extension that helps users track how much time they spend on different websites and provides insights into their productivity. The extension works by monitoring which websites are being visited and for how long, then classifies each site as either productive (like coding platforms) or unproductive (like social media). Based on this data, the extension generates weekly productivity reports and displays analytics in a user-friendly dashboard.

For the development, the Chrome extension was built using standard web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The extension runs in the browser and uses Chrome’s APIs to detect which websites are open and how long the user spends on each one. The user interface is designed to be simple and easy to navigate, with a popup for quick stats and a dashboard for more detailed analytics.

A backend service was set up to store user data securely. This backend can be built with Node.js or Python (using frameworks like Express or Flask), and it connects to a database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL to save time tracking records and productivity classifications. The backend also handles generating weekly reports and serving analytics data to the extension’s dashboard.

The development process included:
- Creating the Chrome extension with a background script to track website activity and a popup for quick access.
- Designing a dashboard page that shows productivity analytics, such as time spent on productive vs. unproductive sites and weekly trends.
- Setting up a backend server to store user data and generate reports.
- Integrating the backend with a database for persistent storage.
- Implementing logic to classify websites and calculate productivity scores.

The extension can be installed in the Chrome browser, and users can view their productivity analytics at any time through the dashboard. The system is designed to be flexible, so new features like custom website categories or daily goals can be added in the future. The main focus was to keep the extension lightweight, easy to use, and effective at helping users understand and improve their online habits.
